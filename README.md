Double Signing in Validator

Issue Description: In versions prior to 32.1, there has been a concerning trend during the upgrade process where incidents of double signing have become more frequent. This worrying phenomenon is often triggered by users neglecting to secure their crucial data stored within the 'priv_validator_key.json' file. Consequently, upon completing the upgrade, the system inadvertently generates a new 'priv_validator_key.json' reflecting the original wallet address and its residual balance. Unfortunately, users then find themselves locked out from accessing the moniker stored in their previous 'priv_validator_key.json'. As a result, they resort to creating a new moniker, unknowingly exacerbating the issue. This significant oversight fundamentally violates the principle that each address should be paired with only one 'priv_validator_key'. Moreover, the presence of different 'priv_validator_key' instances poses an insurmountable hurdle to the transaction signing process.

Impact: The potential ramifications of this bug are severe. Double signing casts a shadow over the network's security and reliability, eroding validators' trust in the system. Furthermore, it opens the door to catastrophic outcomes such as network forks and the perilous loss of user funds.

Recommendations: Urgent Patch: Swift action is necessary to release a patch that effectively addresses this vulnerability. The patch should implement stringent validation mechanisms to prevent the creation of duplicate 'priv_validator_key' instances for identical addresses. Communication: Comprehensive dissemination of information is crucial to inform all validators about the existence and severity of the bug. Clear, concise directives should be provided to guide validators on risk mitigation strategies until the patch is deployed. Audit: A thorough audit of the codebase is warranted to identify any lurking vulnerabilities related to key management and upgrade protocols. Documentation Update: A comprehensive overhaul of the documentation is warranted to emphasize the critical importance of securely storing 'priv_validator_key.json'. Additionally, it should provide validators with exhaustive guidelines outlining the upgrade process.

Conclusion: As a steadfast member of the validator community, it is imperative to expedite the resolution of this critical issue to safeguard the network's integrity and security. I stand ready to provide additional information or assistance in any capacity necessary to expedite the resolution process. However, it should be noted that until now, no specific checks have been conducted on this issue in the latest version 32.1. Therefore, additional verification steps are required to ascertain whether this issue still persists or has been addressed in the newer version. Thank you for your unwavering attention to this matter, and I look forward to swift action being taken to rectify this critical bug.
